# Telegram_bot_analytics
This repository contains some results of my work in TrAI. It has SQL query and dashboard configurations developed for TrAI, a GPT-powered Telegram bot. The project focuses on transforming raw transactional and interaction data from a PostgreSQL database into actionable business insights via Redash.

The primary goal of these scripts was to analyse user behaviour, monitor the bot finance, and optimize marketing spend through CAC calculation.
